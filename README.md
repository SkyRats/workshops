# Object Oriented Programming

<p style="color:red;font-size: 25px;">Repository still over development</p>

## Mission

This guide was developed to help members from Skyrats - Autonomous Drones Team from Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo - to understand the concepts of object oriented programming in C++.

It assumes that the preson who is reading this is already used to programming in C++. If ythis is not your case, please check out the other tutorial about <a href="https://github.com/SkyRats/cpp_workshop">C++ Basic Concepts</a> before following this one.

Since it is a routine for the members to be asked to install Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) when they enter the team, some instructions are given to be inserted on a Linux Terminal.

If that may be an issue, you can easily follow this guide using an IDE (Codeblocks is a good starting IDE).

The **Examples (commented)** section contains examples commented line by line so you may use the other topics usually as *consulting material*.

## Prerequisites

* **Compilers**:

  * GCC (Linux)

  * MinGW (Windows)

3. Encapsulation
4. Constructors and Destructors
5. Inheritance and Polymorphism
6. Abstract Classes and Multiple Inheritance
7. Error Handling
8. Data Persistence
9. Namespace, Templates and Standard Libraries
10. Examples (commented)
