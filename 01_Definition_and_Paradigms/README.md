# 1 - Definition and Paradigms

Developing software does not envolve only a programming language itself, a good aspect to consider when developing anything is the programming paradigm, or the "way" of programming. 

To be more precise Timothy Budd describes it as "... way of conceptualizing what ist means to preform copmutation, of structuring and organizing how tasks are to be carried out on a computer." in his seminal <a href="https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Multiparadigm_Programming_in_Leda.html?id=qqxQAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y">book</a> on multiparadigm programming.

Each language has one or more paradigms. Some examples of paradigms and respective languages:

* Imperative: Pascal and Cobol
* Functional: Lisp, Haskel and Scala
* Logic: Prolog and Datalog
* **Object-Oriented: C++, C#, Java and Python**
* Event-Driven: used mostly in graphcal interfaces
* Declarative: SQL and HTML

In this way, Object Oriented Programming differs from others paradigms because it includes both data and functions. In addition, we are able to create relationships between one object and another.
